# Geospatial Analytics for Social Good

## 1 Overview

### 1.1 Setting the Scene

Water is an important resource to mankind. Clean and accessible water is critical to human health. It provides a healthy environment, a sustainable economy, reduces poverty and ensures peace and security. Yet over 40% of the global population does not have sufficient access to clean water. By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, according to UN-Water. The lack of water poses a major threat to several sectors, including food security. Agriculture uses about 70% of the world's accessible freshwater.

Developing countries are most affected by water shortages and poor water quality. Up to 80% of illnesses in the developing world are linked to inadequate water and sanitation. Despite technological advancement, providing clean water to the rural community is still a major development issue in many countries globally, especially in Africa.

To provide clean and sustainable water supply to the rural community, a global [Water Point Data Exchange (WPdx)](https://www.waterpointdata.org/about/) project was initiated. The main aim of this initiative is to collect water point related data from rural areas at the water point or small water scheme level and share the data via WPdx Data Repository, a cloud-based data library. The data is collected based on [WPDx Data Standard](https://www.waterpointdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/WPDx_Data_Standard.pdf).

### 1.2 Objectives

Geospatial analytics hold tremendous potential to address complex problems facing our society.

In this study, we will apply appropriate global and local measures of spatial association techniques to reveal the spatial patterns of **non-functional** water points in Nigeria.

### 1.3 The Data

Geospatial data

For this assignment, 2 geospatial data sets will be used.

1.  geo_export: It contains information on the water points in Nigeria. The data is available from [WPdx Global Data Repositories](https://www.waterpointdata.org/access-data/) and we are using the WPdx+ data set. The data is extracted and downloaded in shapefile format.

    ![](images/paste-D25947E2.png){width="598"}

2.  nga_lga2: The file contains Nigeria Level-2 Administrative Boundary (also known as Local Government Area (LGA)) polygon features GIS data will be used. The data is downloaded from The [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/) portal

### 1.4 The Tasks

The specific tasks of this assignments are:

-   Using appropriate sf method, import the shapefiles into R and save them in a simple feature data frame format. The Projected Coordinate Systems of Nigeria is EPSG: 26391.

-   Using appropriate tidyr and dplyr methods to derive the proportion of functional and non-functional water point at the LGA level.

-   Combining the geospatial data frames into a Simple Feature (sf) data frame.

-   Performing clusters and outliers analysis by using appropriate local measures of spatial association methods.

-   Performing hotspot areas analysis by using appropriate local measures of spatial association methods.

### 1.5 Thematic Mapping

-   Plot maps to show the spatial distribution of functional and non-functional water point rate at LGA level by using appropriate thematic mapping technique provided by the tmap package.

### 1.6 Analytical Mapping

-   Plot hotspot areas and outliers/clusters maps of functional and non-functional water point rate at LGA level by using appropriate thematic mapping technique provided by tmap package.

## 2 Setup

### 2.1 Import and load relevant packages into R environment

The R packages we use for this analysis are:

-   **sf**: used for importing, managing, and processing geospatial data

-   **tidyverse**: a collection of packages for data manipulation, visualisation and other data science related tasks

-   **tmap**: used for creating thematic maps, such as choropleth and bubble maps

-   **spdep**: used to create spatial weights matrix objects and related calculations (e.g. spatially lag attributes)

-   **funModeling**: a library for rapid Exploratory Data Analysis

-   **units**: for measurement units in R vectors, matrices and array

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, tmap, spdep, funModeling, units)
```

### 2.2 Import the geospatial data sets

#### 2.2.1 Import water point geospatial data

We import the geo_export shapefile using `st_read()` of sf library and use `filter()` of the dplyr package to extract water point records in Nigeria

```{r}
#| eval: false
wp = st_read(dsn = "Take-home_Ex1/geodata",
              layer = "geo_export",
              crs = 4326) %>%
  filter(clean_coun == "Nigeria")
```

::: callout-note
## We do not transform the geographic data at this point as we will be using `st_intersects()` in a later step to process the data. This is because st_intersects() only works correctly if the geospatial data are in geographic coordinate system (i.e. wgs84)
:::

Next, `write_rds()` of readr package is used to save the extracted sf data table (i.e. *wp*) into an output file in rds data format. The output file is called *wp_nga.rds* and it is saved in *geodata* sub-folder.

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(wp, "Take-home_Ex1/geodata/wp_nga.rds")
```

#### 2.2.2 Import Nigeria LGA boundary data

We use `st_read()` to import the LGA boundary data into sf data table

```{r}
#| eval: false
nga = st_read(dsn = "Take-home_Ex1/geodata",
               layer = "nga_lga2",
               crs = 4326)
```

## 3 Data Wrangling

### 3.1 Recode the values in the status_cle column

The *status_cle* column in the *wp_nga.rds* file indicates the status of the water point when it was last assessed.

We do a count of the diferrent values in the *status_cle* column using `freq()` of the funModeling package.

```{r}
#| eval: false
wp_nga = read_rds("Take-home_Ex1/geodata/wp_nga.rds")

freq(data=wp_nga,input = 'status_cle')
```

![](images/paste-53B41B3C.png)

Given that we are going to plot maps relating to the proportion of functional and non-functional water points in Nigeria, we need to first compute the total number of functional, non-functional and blank value (denoted by "NA") water points before we can derive the proportion of non-functional and functional water points for each LGA.

To do so, we perform the following steps:

-   We use the `replace_na()` method to recode all the NA values in *status_cle* column of the *wp_nga* data table into Unknown

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    wp_nga = wp_nga %>%
      mutate(status_cle = replace_na(status_cle, "Unknown"))
    ```

-   We use `filter()` of dplyr to create data tables which group (i) functional, (2) non functional and (3) water points with unknown status together

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    # Extract functional water points
    wpt_functional = wp_nga %>%
      filter(status_cle %in%
               c("Functional", 
                 "Functional but not in use",
                 "Functional but needs repair"))

    # Extract non-functional water points
    wpt_nonfunctional = wp_nga %>%
      filter(status_cle %in%
               c("Abandoned/Decommissioned", 
                 "Abandoned",
                 "Non-Functional",
                 "Non functional due to dry season",
                 "Non-Functional due to dry season"))

    # Extract water points with Unknown value
    wpt_unknown = wp_nga %>%
      filter(status_cle == "Unknown")
    ```

### 3.2 Perform Point-in-Polygon Count

We use `st_intersects()` of sf package to compute the number of functional, non-functional and unknown status water points in each LGA.

```{r}
#| eval: false

nga_wp = nga %>% 
  mutate(`total wpt` = lengths(
    st_intersects(nga, wp_nga))) %>%
  mutate(`wpt functional` = lengths(
    st_intersects(nga, wpt_functional))) %>%
  mutate(`wpt non-functional` = lengths(
    st_intersects(nga, wpt_nonfunctional))) %>%
  mutate(`wpt unknown` = lengths(
    st_intersects(nga, wpt_unknown)))
```

### 3.3 Save the data table for spatial analysis

We derive two fields namely *pct_functional* and *pct_non-functional* using the `mutate()` of dplyr package. To keep the file size small, we use `select()` of dplyr to retain only columns 3,4,9,10, 18,19,20,21,22,and 23.

```{r}
#| eval: false
nga_wp = nga_wp %>%
  mutate(pct_functional = `wpt functional`/`total wpt`) %>%
  mutate(`pct_non-functional` = `wpt non-functional`/`total wpt`) %>%
  select(3:4, 9:10, 18:23)
```

Thereafter ,we save the updated *nga_wp* sf data table into rds format for our geospatial analysis

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(nga_wp, "Take-home_Ex1/geodata/nga_wp.rds")
```

### 3.4 Visualise the geographic distribution of water points

We first load the *nga_wp* sf.data frame in the R environment.

```{r}

# Load the nga_wp sf data file prepare in the previous steps
nga_wp <- read_rds("Take-home_Ex1/geodata/nga_wp.rds")
```

Next, the plot the choropleth by the status of the water points.

```{r fig.width=14, fig.height=12}
# Plot the various types of water points
total = qtm(nga_wp, "total wpt") + 
        tm_layout(main.title = "Total no. of \nwater points",
                  main.title.position = "center",
                  main.title.size = 1.5,
                  legend.height = 0.26,
                  legend.width = 0.40) 

wp_functional = qtm(nga_wp, "wpt functional") + 
                tm_layout(main.title = "Total no. of functional \nwater points",
                  main.title.position = "center",
                  main.title.size = 1.5,
                  legend.height = 0.26,
                  legend.width = 0.40) 

wp_nonfunctional = qtm(nga_wp, "wpt non-functional") + 
                tm_layout(main.title = "Total no. of non-functional \nwater points",
                  main.title.position = "center",
                  main.title.size = 1.5,
                  legend.height = 0.26,
                  legend.width = 0.40)

unknown <- qtm(nga_wp, "wpt unknown") + 
                tm_layout(main.title = "Total no. of  water points \nwith unknown status",
                  main.title.position = "center",
                  main.title.size = 1.5,
                  legend.height = 0.26,
                  legend.width = 0.40)

tmap_arrange(total, wp_functional, wp_nonfunctional, unknown, ncol=2)
```

## 4 Data Processing

Before we start working on our data, we first check for and address the following to ensure that they do not affect subsequent computations in our analysis:

-   Invalid geometries

-   missing values

### 4.1 Invalid geometries

We use the `st_is_valid()` function from sf package to check whether the geometries in *nga_wp* are valid. We wrap the `st_is_valid()` using `length()` function to count the number of invalid geometries returned.

```{r}
length(which(st_is_valid(nga_wp) == FALSE))
```

This is no invalid geometry

### 4.2 Missing values

We use the following code chunk to check every row in the *nga_wp* sf data table to see if there is any NA value. If so, to return these records.

```{r}
nga_wp[rowSums(is.na(nga_wp))!=0,]
```

The results show that there are 13 records with missing values, primarily in the *pct_functional* and *pct_non-functional* columns. The 13 LGAs have no water point record at all and this resulted in a divisional error (and generating a NaN value) when we compute the percentage of functional and non-functional water points.

We will remove these 13 records with missing values to avoid any unintended computational issue in our analysis downstream with the following code chunk.

```{r}
nga_wp_processed <- na.omit(nga_wp,c("pct_non-functional"))
```

### 4.3 Transform coordinate system

We first check the coordinate system of *nga_wp_processed* using `st_crs()` of the sf package.

```{r}
st_crs(nga_wp_processed)
```

We note that the geometry information is reflected under WGS 84, a Geographic Coordinate System (GCS) which uses a 3-dimensional spherical surface to define locations on the earth. For our study, we will transform the geometry to Projected Coordinate System. This translates GCS data into a 2-dimensional surface using `st_transform()` of the sf package. The Projected Coordinate Systems of Nigeria is EPSG: 26391.

```{r}
nga_wp_projected <- st_transform(nga_wp_processed, crs=26391)

# check to ascertain if the CRS is correctly projected
st_crs(nga_wp_projected)
```

### 4.4 Checking the distribution of the attribute

We note that the % value of non-functional water points are right-skewed by plotting histogram using ggplot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=nga_wp_projected, aes(x= as.numeric(`pct_non-functional`)))+
  geom_histogram(bins=20,
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue") +
  labs(y='Frequency',x="% of non-functional water points", title = "Distribution of % of non-functional water points")
```

We also plot the % value of functional water points using ggplot as follows:

```{r}
ggplot(data=nga_wp_projected, aes(x= as.numeric(`pct_functional`)))+
  geom_histogram(bins=20,
                 color="black", 
                 fill="blue") +
  labs(y='Frequency',x="% of functional water points", title = "Distribution of % of functional water points")
```

The distribution of the proportion of functional water points is slightly skewed as well.

### 4.5 Visualise the processed data

We have completed the standard pre-processing steps and let us visualise the water data on the map with the following code chuck. We use the jenks method to classify the data points as it optimises class variances to determine the best arrangement off values into different classes

[To visualise the proportion of non-functional water points over Nigera]{.underline}

```{r}
tm_shape(nga_wp_projected) +
  tm_fill("pct_non-functional", 
          style = "jenks", 
          palette = "Blues",
          title = "% of non-functional wps") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Proportion of non-functional \nwater points",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.2)
```

We will can roughly spot that the western part (especially in the south-west region) of the country has relatively more non-functional points.

[To visualise the proportion of functional water points over Nigera]{.underline}

```{r}
tm_shape(nga_wp_projected) +
  tm_fill("pct_functional", 
          style = "jenks", 
          palette = "Greens",
          title = "% of functional wps") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Proportion of functional \nwater points",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.2)
```

From the map above, we see that north east and north west of Nigeria have higher proportion of functional water points.

## 5 Global Spatial Autocorrelation

We start by first examining if there is global spatial autocorrelation among LGAs with non-functional water points, which is the objective of our study, using the following hypothesis:

H0: The distribution of non-functional water points is a random phenomenon

H1: The distribution of non-functional water points is spatially dependent

We set the level of significance, α at 0.05.

### 5.1 Select the appropriate Spatial Weight for our analysis

There are 2 main criterion for defining spatial weights:

-   Contiguity or Adjacency criterion

-   Distance criterion:

    -   Fixed Distance

    -   Adaptive Distance

Given that we have removed 13 LGAs with missing values from the data table, applying the Contiguity criterion for spatial weights may not be ideal as we have suppressed the number of connections among contiguous LGAs. We generate the Neighbour List with Queen contiguity approach using `poly2nd()` of spdep package below and note that the number of neighbors for the LGAs range from 1 to 14, which is not very consistent.

```{r}
wm_q = poly2nb(nga_wp_projected,queen=TRUE)

summary(wm_q)
```

To overcome the reservations we have on using the Contiguity criterion to determine the spatial weights, one way is to use distance-based criterion and there are 2 schemes available - Fixed Distance and Adaptive Distance

For Fixed Distance scheme, while we can make use of `dnearneigh()` function of spdep package to compute the distance weight matrix distance where all LGAs have at least 1 neighbor, the LGA polygons are of very different sizes and therefore we may generate excessive/limited number of neighbors for some LGAs by using a fixed distance. For instance, bigger regions at the boundaries of the map tend to have fewer neighbors and hence are less likely to obtain statistically significant results. To get a sense of how different the LGAs are in terms of land size, we plot the following histogram on the area of the LGAs using `st_area()` of sf package.

```{r}
options(scipen=999)

nga_wp_projected$area = st_area(nga_wp_projected)

ggplot(data=nga_wp_projected, aes(x= area))+
  geom_histogram(bins=20,
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue") +
  labs(y='Frequency',x="Area", title = "Distribution of LGA areas")
```

We also print out the relevant area statistics to show the wide range in land area of the LGAs

```{r}

summary(st_area(nga_wp_projected))
```

A solution to the concerns for the Contiguity and Fixed Distance criterion is to adopt the Adaptive Distance scheme where we preset a fixed number of k neighbors per LGA. All LGAs are hence connected by the same number of neighbours.

Based on the discussion above, [we will use Adaptive Distance weight matrix and set k = 8 for our subsequent analysis]{.underline} to strike a balance between not having too high a k value (which may have a smoothening out effect on the values) and being able to obtain statistically-sound results eventually. Setting k = 8 also takes into account that the distribution of the proportion non-functional water points is skewed as seen in Section 4.4.

### 5.2 Compute the Adaptive Distance weight matrix

#### 5.2.1 Derive the centroid of every LGA

We need the centroid associated with each LGA before we can work out the neighbor list.

To get the longitude values of the centroids, we map the `st_centroid()` function over the geometry column of our projected sf table and access the longitude value through double bracket notation \[\[\]\] and 1.

```{r}
longitude <- map_dbl(nga_wp_projected$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])
```

We do the same for latitude but access the second value of each centroid with \[\[2\]\].

```{r}
latitude <- map_dbl(nga_wp_projected$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])
```

Thereafter we combined the longitude and latitude into the same object and review the first few records to check that the coordinates of the centroids are correctly formatted.

```{r}
# Combine the longitude and latitude values into an array object
coords = cbind(longitude,latitude)

# Insepct the first few records of the object
head(coords)
```

The first 6 sets of centroid coordinates appear fine.

#### 5.2.2 Derive the Neighbor List

Next. we use the `knearneigh()` of spdep package to obtain the Neighbor List (nb) object for the LGAs, setting k = 8

```{r}
knn8 <- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=8))
knn8
```

#### 5.2.3 Convert the Neighbor List object into a Spatial Weights object

Finally, we use the `nb2listw()` of spdep package to convert the Neighbor List into a Spatial Weights object.

```{r}
knn8_lw <- nb2listw(knn8, style = 'B')

# Inspect the spatial weights object
summary(knn8_lw)

```

### 5.3 Run the Moran's I test for Global Autocorrelation

We perform the Moran's I statistical testing using `moran.test()` of spdep package. The Moran's I test measures how the proportions of non-functional water points differ in the study area as a whole.

```{r}
moran.test(nga_wp_projected$`pct_non-functional`, 
           listw=knn8_lw, 
           zero.policy = TRUE)
```

The p-value is \<0.05 implying that we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the spatial distribution of non-functional water points is not a random phenomenon. The positive Moran's I statistic of 0.450 indicates that there's some some degree of clustering of non-functional water points in our study area.

### 5.4 Run the Geary's C test for Global Autocorrelation

To confirm that there is global clustering of non-functional water points, we perform the Geary's C statistical test using `geary.test()` of spdep package. The Geary's C test measures how the proportion of the non-functional water points in LGAs differ from their neighbors.

```{r}
geary.test(nga_wp_projected$`pct_non-functional`, 
           listw=knn8_lw, 
           zero.policy = TRUE)
```

The Geary's C statistic is between 0 and 1, indicating that there is global clustering and the proportion of non-functional water points between the LGAs and their neighbors tend to be similar in some regions of Nigeria. The p-value is \<0.05 implying that the result is statistically significant.

From the Moran's I and Geary's G tests, we conclude that the spatial distribution of non-functional water points is not a random phenomenon and there is indeed clustering of faulty water points.

## 6 Cluster and Outlier Analysis

In this section, we compute the Local Indicators of Spatial Association ("LISA") statistics to evaluate the existence of clusters and outliers in the spatial arrangement of non-functional water points across Nigeria.

### 6.1 Compute the local Moran's I

The Local Moran's I statistic is relatively similar to the Global Moran's I in that it is providing a measure of how similar locations are to their neighbors. However, the difference is that each LGA receive its own Moran's I value, as well as its own variance, z value, expected I, and variance of I

We use the `localmoran()` of spdep package to compute the local Moran's I for non-functional water points.

```{r}
localMI <- localmoran(nga_wp_projected$`pct_non-functional`, knn8_lw)

# Inspect the first few records generated
head(localMI)
```

The column on the far right provides the p-values. We can relate these p-values to different confidence levels (e.g. 99%, 95%, etc.) in order to draw a conclusion about the spatial distribution of non-functional water points across the LGAs.

For ease of subsequent analysis, we create a sf data table by appending the local Moran's I dataframe (i.e. localMI) onto *nga_wp_projected* data table. At the same time, we rename the p-value column for the local Moran's I to "Pr.li".

```{r}
nga_wp_projected.localMI <- cbind(nga_wp_projected,localMI) %>%
  rename(Pr.Ii = Pr.z....E.Ii..)
```

### 6.2 Map the local Moran's I statistic and the Moran's I p-value

Using choropleth mapping functions of **tmap** package, we plot 2 maps:

-   Map 1 representing the local Moran's I values

-   Map 2 representing the local Moran's I p-values

[For non-functional water-points]{.underline}

```{r}
#| warning: false
# 1. Map 1 representing the Local Moran's I values

localMI.map <- tm_shape(nga_wp_projected.localMI) +
  tm_fill(col = "Ii", 
          style = "pretty", 
          title = "Local Moran's I statistics",
          palette = "BrBG") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Map 1: Local Moran's I statistics \n(Non-functional water points)",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.2,
            legend.height = 0.26, 
            legend.width = 0.40)

# 2. Map representing the local Moran's I p-values

pvalue.map <- tm_shape(nga_wp_projected.localMI) +
  tm_fill(col = "Pr.Ii",
          breaks=c(-Inf, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, Inf),
          palette="-BuPu",
          title = "local Moran's I p-values") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Map 2: Local Moran's I p-values \n(non-functional water points)",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.2,
            legend.height = 0.26, 
            legend.width = 0.40)

tmap_arrange(localMI.map, pvalue.map, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

[For functional water points]{.underline}

Similarly, we map the local Moran I statistics for functional water points by repeating the steps in Sections 6.1 and 6.2

```{r}
#| warning: false
# Generate the local Moran's I
localMI_func <- localmoran(nga_wp_projected$`pct_functional`, knn8_lw)

# Append local Moran's I values to data frame
nga_wp_projected.localMI_func <- cbind(nga_wp_projected,localMI_func) %>%
  rename(Pr.Ii = Pr.z....E.Ii..)


# Map 1 representing the Local Moran's I values

localMI_func.map <- tm_shape(nga_wp_projected.localMI_func) +
  tm_fill(col = "Ii", 
          style = "pretty", 
          title = "Local Moran's I statistics",
          palette = "BrBG") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Map 1a: Local Moran's I statistics \n(functional water points)",
            main.title.position = "center",

### 6.3 Plot the LISA map

Before plotting the map, we need to first prepare the map classes. The preparatory steps involved are as follow:

1.  Create a vector to contain the cluster class: quadrant

2.  Derive the spatially lagged values for proportion of non-functional water points and center them around the mean value using `lag.listtw()` of spdep package: DV

3.  Center the local Moran's I values around the mean value: LM_I

4.  Set the level of significance for the local Moran's I statistic: signif

5.  Define and assign the classes based on DV and LM_I values.

    -   \[DV \<0 & LM_I\>0\] \<- 1 Low-Low

    -   \[DV \>0 & LM_I\<0\] \<- 2 Low-High

    -   \[DV \<0 & LM_I\<0\] \<- 3 High-Low

    -   \[DV \>0 & LM_I\>0\] \<- 4 High-High

6.  Allocate non-significant Moran's I value to 0

[For non-functional water-points]{.underline}

```{r}
# Step 1
quadrant <- vector(mode="numeric",length=nrow(localMI))

# Step 2
nga_wp_projected$`lag_pct_non-functional` <- lag.listw(knn8_lw, nga_wp_projected$`pct_non-functional`)
DV <- nga_wp_projected$`lag_pct_non-functional` - mean(nga_wp_projected$`lag_pct_non-functional`)     

# Step 3
LM_I <- localMI[,1] - mean(localMI[,1])   

# Step 4
signif <- 0.05       

# Step 5
quadrant[DV <0 & LM_I>0] <- 1
quadrant[DV >0 & LM_I<0] <- 2
quadrant[DV <0 & LM_I<0] <- 3  
quadrant[DV >0 & LM_I>0] <- 4

# Step 6
quadrant[localMI[,5]>signif] <- 0
```

Using choropleth mapping functions of tmap package, we plot 2 additional maps:

-   Map 3 representing the proportion of non-functional water points
-   Map 4 representing the LISA map of spatial clusters

```{r}
# Map 3 representing the Proportion of non-functional water points
non_functional_wp <- tm_shape(nga_wp_projected) +
  tm_fill("pct_non-functional", 
          style = "jenks", 
          palette = "Blues",
          title = "% of non-functional wps") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Map 3: Proportion of non-functional \nwater points",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.2)

# Map 4 representing the LISA map of spatial clusters
nga_wp_projected.localMI$quadrant <- quadrant
colors <- c("#999999", "#2c7bb6", "#abd9e9", "#fdae61", "#d7191c")
clusters <- c("insignificant", "low-low", "low-high", "high-low", "high-high")

LISAmap <- tm_shape(nga_wp_projected.localMI) +
  tm_fill(col = "quadrant", 
          style = "cat", 
          palette = colors[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1], 
          labels = clusters[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1],
          popup.vars = c("")) +
  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,17)) +
  tm_borders(alpha=0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Map 4: LISA map of spatial clusters \n(non-functional water points)",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.2)

tmap_arrange(non_functional_wp, LISAmap, 
             asp=1, ncol=2)
```

[For functional water-points]{.underline}

We repeat the steps above to plot the maps for functional water points.

```{r}
# Step 1
quadrant_func <- vector(mode="numeric",length=nrow(localMI_func))

# Step 2
nga_wp_projected$`lag_pct_functional` <- lag.listw(knn8_lw, nga_wp_projected$`pct_functional`)
DV_func <- nga_wp_projected$`lag_pct_functional` - mean(nga_wp_projected$`lag_pct_functional`)     

# Step 3
LM_I_func <- localMI_func[,1] - mean(localMI_func[,1])   

# Step 4
signif <- 0.05       

# Step 5
quadrant_func[DV_func <0 & LM_I_func>0] <- 1

          style = "cat", 
          palette = colors[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1],

            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.2)

tmap_arrange(functional_wp, LISAmap_func, 
             asp=1, ncol=2)
```

### 6.4 Interpretation of LISA analysis results

Our discussion below will be based on non-functional water points which is the objective of our study.

Map 3 shows the regions with higher proportion of non-function water points were mainly spread throughout the western part of Nigeria, especially in the south-west region. The Global Moran's I and Geary's C computed in sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 respectively confirmed that there's some degree of gloabal clustering of non-functional water points in Nigeria. So this begs the question of where do the clusters of non-functional water points lie. In terms of efforts to review, inspect and repair these faulty water points, it would be more cost effective if we can identify where they are congregated to manage them as a cluster.

Based on the local Moran's I values (Map 1) and p-values (Map 2), we observe that significant clusters appear in the north-east and south-west of the country.

The LISA map (Map 4) makes it easier for us by highlighting the 4 separate high-high clusters (labelled in the enlarged LISA map below) and, attention should be placed on Clusters 1 and 2 given the wider spread of non-functional water points and larger number of LGAs affected.

![](images/paste-8891987B.png){fig-align="center" width="536"}

It is also interesting to note that most low-low clusters are gathered around the north-east part of the country and it maybe worth investigating why the region has lower proportion of water points failures. Most of the low-high and high-low outliers are adjacent to high-high and low-low clusters, which is understandable given that each LGA's classification is relative to its neighbors. There are pockets of high-low outliers (in orange) spread across the study area. The local administration of these high-low areas should be alerted to their classification as "outliers" and encouraged to address the seemingly higher proportion of faulty water points vis-a-vis their neighbors .

## 7 Hot Spot and Cold Spot Area Analysis

Hot spots refer to regions with attribute values that are higher relative to its surroundings. We will use Getis-Ord's Gi statistics to detect such spatial anomalies. The method looks at neighbors within a defined proximity to identify where high or low values cluster spatially. Statistically significant hot-spots are defined as areas of high values where other areas within the neighborhood range also share high values too.

The analysis consists of three steps:

-   Derive spatial weight matrix

-   Compute Gi statistics

-   Map Gi statistics

We have accomplished Step 1 in Section 4.2 when we have already derived the Adaptive Distance Weight Matrix. Therefore we will next compute the Gi statistics

### 7.1 Compute Gi statistics using adaptive distance weight matrix

We use the `localG()` of spdep package to derive the local GI statistics and then create a sf data table by appending the local Gi statistics onto *nga_wp_projected* data table. At the same time, we rename the Gi statistics column to *gstat_adaptive*.

[For non-functional water-points]{.underline}

```{r}
# Compute the local Gi statistics
gi.adaptive <- localG(nga_wp_projected$`pct_non-functional`, knn8_lw, zero.policy = FALSE)


# Create nga_wp_projected.gi sf data table to store the Gi statistics
nga_wp_projected.gi <- cbind(nga_wp_projected, as.matrix(gi.adaptive)) %>%
  rename(gstat_adaptive = as.matrix.gi.adaptive.)
```

### 7.2 Mark the Gi statistics that are significant

The `localG()` function returns a Z-value and we will check this against the critical value setting the level of significance at 0.05. Based on the documentation for [locaG() function,](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/localG.html) the critical values of the statistic under assumptions given in the references for the 95th percentile are for n=1: 1.645, n=50: 3.083, n=100: 3.289, n=1000: 3.886. For our analysis, we will use the more stringent critical value of 3.886 to define statistical significance. We will create an indicator column in the *nga_wp_projected.gi* data table for Gi statistics that are significant.

[For non-functional water-points]{.underline}

```{r}
critial_value <- 3.886

nga_wp_projected.gi = nga_wp_projected.gi %>%
  mutate(gi_sig_indicator = case_when(
    abs(gstat_adaptive)> critial_value ~ "Yes",
    abs(gstat_adaptive)<= critial_value ~ "No"
    ))
```

### 7.3 Map Gi values with adaptive distance weights

We use the choropleth mapping functions of **tmap** package, we plot 2 maps:

-   Map 5 representing the local Gi Z-values

-   Map 6 representing areas with significant Gi Z-values

[For non-functional water-points]{.underline}

```{r}

# Map 5 representing the Hot and Cold spots using Gi Statistics
Gimap <- tm_shape(nga_wp_projected.gi) +
  tm_fill(col = "gstat_adaptive",
          style = "pretty",
          palette="-RdBu", 
          title = "local Gi") + 
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)  +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Map 5: Gi values with \nadaptive distance weights",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.2)

# Map 6 representing the spots with significant Gi Statistics
Gimap_sig <- tm_shape(nga_wp_projected.gi) +
  tm_fill(col = "gi_sig_indicator",
          palette = "-RdGy",
          title = "Significant Gi") + 
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)  +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Map 6: LGAs with significant \nGi Statistic",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.2)

tmap_arrange(Gimap, Gimap_sig, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

[For functional water-points]{.underline}

We repeat the steps in section 7.1 to 7.3 above to plot the maps for functional water points.

```{r}
# Compute the local Gi statistics
gi.adaptive_func <- localG(nga_wp_projected$`pct_functional`, knn8_lw, zero.policy = FALSE)


# Create nga_wp_projected.gi sf data table to store the Gi statistics
nga_wp_projected.gi_func <- cbind(nga_wp_projected, as.matrix(gi.adaptive_func)) %>%
  rename(gstat_adaptive_func = as.matrix.gi.adaptive_func.)


# Identify GI statistics that are signficant
critial_value <- 3.886

nga_wp_projected.gi_func = nga_wp_projected.gi_func %>%
  mutate(gi_sig_indicator_func = case_when(
    abs(gstat_adaptive_func)> critial_value ~ "Yes",
    abs(gstat_adaptive_func)<= critial_value ~ "No"
    ))

# Map Gi values
# Map 5a representing the Hot and Cold spots using Gi Statistics for functional water points
Gimap_func <- tm_shape(nga_wp_projected.gi_func) +
  tm_fill(col = "gstat_adaptive_func",
          style = "pretty",
          palette="-RdBu", 
          title = "local Gi") + 
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)  +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Map 5a: Gi values for \nfunctional water points",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.2)

# Map 6 representing the spots with significant Gi Statistics
Gimap_sig_func <- tm_shape(nga_wp_projected.gi_func) +
  tm_fill(col = "gi_sig_indicator_func",
          palette = "-RdGy",
          title = "Significant Gi") + 
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)  +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Map 6a: LGAs with significant Gi \nstats for functional water points",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.2)

tmap_arrange(Gimap_func, Gimap_sig_func, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

### 7.4 Interpretation of Hot-spot area analysis

Our discussion below will be based on non-functional water points which is the objective of our study.

Based on Maps 5 and 6, there are 3 regions of hot-spots and 2 regions of cold-spots that are statistically significant.

![](images/paste-865A0B27.png){fig-align="center" width="421"}

In terms of planning and management of repairs, priority can be given to these 3 hot-spot regions (labelled in red octagons) given that the proportional of non-functional water points are relative to their neighbors. It is also worth noting that all 3 hot-spots regions are within high-high clusters under the LISA map.

For the 2 cold-spot regions (labelled in blue octagons), it would be interesting to see if there are any factors which influence the lower proportion of faulty water points and consider if they are relevant to prevent the water point malfunctioning at other LGAs, especially those in the high-high clusters or hot-spot regions.

## 8 Conclusion

As illustrated by this case study, geospatial autocorrelation analysis can help water point policy makers, maintenance teams to identify clusters and hot-spots for non-functional water points, plan for and priortise the repairs. On the other hand, a further examination of the outliers and cold-spots could offer insights on how water point failures can be avoided to provide clean and adequate water supply to improve the lives of the people in Nigeria.

Geospatial analytics can indeed be a useful tool to help organisations and entities optimise the use of their limited resources and make informed decisions that are data driven.
