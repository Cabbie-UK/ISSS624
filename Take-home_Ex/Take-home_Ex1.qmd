# Geospatial Analytics for Social Good

## 1.1 Setting the Scene

Water is an important resource to mankind. Clean and accessible water is critical to human health. It provides a healthy environment, a sustainable economy, reduces poverty and ensures peace and security. Yet over 40% of the global population does not have access to sufficient clean water. By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, according to UN-Water. The lack of water poses a major threat to several sectors, including food security. Agriculture uses about 70% of the world's accessible freshwater.

Developing countries are most affected by water shortages and poor water quality. Up to 80% of illnesses in the developing world are linked to inadequate water and sanitation. Despite technological advancement, providing clean water to the rural community is still a major development issue in many countries globally, especially in Africa.

To provide clean and sustainable water supply to the rural community, a global [Water Point Data Exchange (WPdx)](https://www.waterpointdata.org/about/) project has been initiated. The main aim of this initiative is to collect water point related data from rural areas at the water point or small water scheme level and share the data via WPdx Data Repository, a cloud-based data library. The data is collected based on [WPDx Data Standard](https://www.waterpointdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/WPDx_Data_Standard.pdf).

1.2 Objectives

Geospatial analytics hold tremendous potential to address complex problems facing society. In this study, we will apply appropriate global and local measures of spatial association techniques to reveal the spatial patterns of **non-functional** water points in Nigeria.

1.3 The Data

Aspatial data

For this assignment, data from [WPdx Global Data Repositories](https://www.waterpointdata.org/access-data/) will be used. There are two versions of the data. They are: WPdx-Basic and WPdx+. We will use WPdx+ data set.

Geospatial data

Nigeria Level-2 Administrative Boundary (also known as Local Government Area) polygon features GIS data will be used. The data can be downloaded from [geoBoundaries](https://www.geoboundaries.org/), (ISO-3 = "NGA", Level - "ADM2").

1.4 The Tasks The specific tasks of this assignments are as follows:

-   Using appropriate sf method, import the shapefile into R and save it in a simple feature data frame format. Note that there are three Projected Coordinate Systems of Nigeria, they are: EPSG: 26391, 26392, and 26303. You can use any one of them.

-   Using appropriate tidyr and dplyr methods, derive the proportion of functional and non-functional water point at LGA level.

-   Combining the geospatial and aspatial data frame into simple feature data frame.

-   Performing outliers/clusters analysis by using appropriate local measures of spatial association methods.

-   Performing hotspot areas analysis by using appropriate local measures of spatial association methods.

1.5 Thematic Mapping

-   Plot maps to show the spatial distribution of functional and non-functional water point rate at LGA level by using appropriate thematic mapping technique provided by tmap package.

1.6 Analytical Mapping

-   Plot hotspot areas and outliers/clusters maps of functional and non0functional water point rate at LGA level by using appropriate thematic mapping technique provided by tmap package.
