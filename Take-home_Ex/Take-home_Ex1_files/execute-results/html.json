Clean and accessible water is critical to human health. It provides a healthy environment, a sustainable economy, reduces poverty and ensures peace and security. Yet over 40% of the global population does not have access to sufficient clean water. By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, according to UN-Water. The lack of water poses a major threat to several sectors, including food security. Agriculture uses about 70% of the world's accessible freshwater.\n\nDeveloping countries are most affected by water shortages and poor water quality. Up to 80% of illnesses in the developing world are linked to inadequate water and sanitation. Despite technological advancement, providing clean water to the rural community is still a major development issue in many countries globally, especially in Africa.\n\nTo provide clean and sustainable water supply to the rural community, a global [Water Point Data Exchange (WPdx)](https://www.waterpointdata.org/about/) project was initiated. The main aim of this initiative is to collect water point related data from rural areas at the water point or small water scheme level and share the data via WPdx Data Repository, a cloud-based data library. The data is collected based on [WPDx Data Standard](https://www.waterpointdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/WPDx_Data_Standard.pdf).\n\n1.2 Objectives\n\nGeospatial analytics hold tremendous potential to address complex problems facing society.\n\nIn this study, we will apply appropriate global and local measures of spatial association techniques to reveal the spatial patterns of **non-functional** water points in Nigeria.\n\n1.3 The Data\n\nGeospatia data\n\nFor this assignment, 2 datasets will be used.\n\n1.  geo_export: It contains information on the water points in Nigeria. The data is available from [WPdx Global Data Repositories](https://www.waterpointdata.org/access-data/) and we are using the WPdx+ data set. Download the data in shapefile format.\n\n    ![](images/paste-D25947E2.png){width=\"788\"}\n\n2.  nga_lga2: The contains Nigeria Level-2 Administrative Boundary (also known as Local Government Area) polygon features GIS data will be used. The data can be downloaded from [geoBoundaries](https://www.geoboundaries.org/), (Select ISO-3 = \"NGA\", Level = \"ADM2\").\n\n1.4 The Tasks\n\nThe specific tasks of this assignments are:\n\n-   Using appropriate sf method, import the shapefiles into R and save it in a simple feature data frame format. The Projected Coordinate Systems of Nigeria, EPSG: 26391 is used\n\n-   Using appropriate tidyr and dplyr methods, derive the proportion of functional and non-functional water point at LGA level.\n\n-   Combining the geospatial data frames into a Simple Feature (`sf`) data frame.\n\n-   Performing outliers/clusters analysis by using appropriate local measures of spatial association methods.\n\n-   Performing hotspot areas analysis by using appropriate local measures of spatial association methods.\n\n1.5 Thematic Mapping\n\n-   Plot maps to show the spatial distribution of functional and non-functional water point rate at LGA level by using appropriate thematic mapping technique provided by tmap package.\n\n1.6 Analytical Mapping\n\n-   Plot hotspot areas and outliers/clusters maps of functional and non-functional water point rate at LGA level by using appropriate thematic mapping technique provided by tmap package.\n\n2 Setup\n\n2.1 Import and load relevant packages into R environment\n\nThe R packages we'll use for this analysis are:\n\n-   **sf**: used for importing, managing, and processing geospatial data\n\n-   **tidyverse**: a collection of packages for data manipulation, visualisation and other science related tasks\n\n-   **tmap**: used for creating thematic maps, such as choropleth and bubble maps\n\n-   **spdep**: used to create spatial weights matrix objects and related calculations (e.g.Â spatially lag attributes)\n\n-   **funModeling**: a library for rapid Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, tmap, spdep, funModeling)\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.2 Import the Geospatial data sets\n\nWe import the geo_export shapefile using `st_read()` of sf library and use `filter()` of the dplyr package to extract water point records in Nigeria\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwp = st_read(dsn = \"Take-home_Ex1/geodata\",\n              layer = \"geo_export\",\n              crs = 4326) %>%\n  filter(clean_coun == \"Nigeria\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## We do not transform the coordinates at this point as we will be using st_interesects in a later step to process data. This is because st_intersects() only works correctly if the geospatial data are in geographic coordinate system (i.e. wgs84)\n:::\n",
